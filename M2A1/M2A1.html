      <!--Narrative topic of the website.-->
      <p> <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA's</abbr> <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/">Insight Project</a> opens a new window of exploration into the geological subsurface of mars. The lander is an
        improved upon design of the resilient <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr> Mars Phoenix lander.
        The robotic arm built within the lander is over 5 feet in length and it lifts multiple different types of equipment
        such as a seismometer and heat flow probe from the deck and places them on the surface of the red planet.
        <br>
        <br>
        Seen below is an discriptive photograph of the landers arm mechansism. This mechansism is responsible for the management of
        the scientific instruments installed on the lander itself.

      <h2>Getting to Mars</h2>
        <p>On November 26, 2018, <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA's</abbr> Insight Lander touched
          down successfully on the Martian surface. American Museum of Natural History science visualization team created the following simulation of the landing using interactive data
          and visualization software.
