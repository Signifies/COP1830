          <p> <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA's</abbr> <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/">Insight Project</a> opens a new window of exploration into the geological subsurface of mars. The lander is an
            improved upon design of the resilient <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr> Mars Phoenix lander.
            The robotic arm built within the lander is over 5 feet in length and it lifts multiple different types of equipment
            such as a seismometer and heat flow probe from the deck and places them on the surface of the red planet.

            Seen below is an discriptive photograph of the landers arm mechansism. This mechansism is responsible for the management of
            the scientific instruments installed on the lander itself.

          <h2>Getting to Mars</h2>
            <p>On November 26, 2018, <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA's</abbr> Insight Lander touched
              down successfully on the Martian surface. American Museum of Natural History science visualization team created the following simulation of the landing using interactive data
              and visualization software.

            <h2>What's next for Insight?</h2>
              <p>After Insignts landing, it will take up a stationary position on Mars. Unlike past missions which usually sent a rover,
              the lander will stay for two years in its current location. Since its short time on Mars, the lander has already taken several photographs
            and audio recordings and sent them to Earth. </p>

            <p>The first science data won't be expected until March, but the lander will be sharing images with it's time on Mars. The information gathered here will
            apply to more than just the red planet and it will help humanity develop a better understanding of rocky planets in general.
