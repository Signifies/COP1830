          <p>A variety of my projects include game development, custom application development, (Raspberry PI) and server management, and Ricing.
            My hobbies include natural photography, specififically of astrological bodies including the moon and beyond.
            When I have some free time I love writing custom <a href="https://github.com/Signifies/rice/tree/master/Arch">dot files</a> for Linux distributions, specifically <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>.
            However, I plan on making an overall contribution that is compatibile with other distributions.</p>
