          <p>A variety of my projects include game development, custom application development, (Raspberry PI) and server management, and Ricing. A few of these can be observed below.
            My hobbies include natural photography, specififically of astrological bodies including the moon and beyond.
            When I have some free time I love writing custom <a href="https://github.com/Signifies/rice/tree/master/Arch">dot files</a> for Linux distributions, specifically <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>.
            However, I plan on making an overall contribution that is compatibile with other distributions.</p>
